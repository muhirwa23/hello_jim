Welcome to the "Hack the Future" app, a forward-thinking solution created to address critical mental health challenges facing youth in Rwanda and across Africa. This project harnesses advanced AI and data analytics to provide actionable insights and support, leveraging a robust tech stack including **Streamlit**, **Google Colab**, and cutting-edge machine learning models. 

## 🌍 Project Vision

Our mission is to create a data-driven mental health platform that provides powerful insights and predictive capabilities for mental health professionals, policy-makers, and communities alike. By empowering stakeholders with real-time analytics, we aim to enhance mental well-being and support for youth in Africa.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards provide clear insights into mental health trends among youth.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Advanced ML models predict mental health outcomes based on various demographic and socio-economic factors.
- **AI Chatbot for Mental Health**: A responsive chatbot offers immediate support and answers to frequently asked questions about mental health.
- **Professional Directory**: Connect with a network of mental health professionals for additional guidance and support.
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in multiple languages, including English and Kinyarwanda, for broader accessibility.
- **Community Forum**: An anonymous space for users to share experiences and support each other in a safe environment.
